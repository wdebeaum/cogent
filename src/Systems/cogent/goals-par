# The goals-par file lists the goal hierarchy in terms of which goals can be
# top-level goals by themselves (those with no parent) and which are only
# subgoals of the listed parent goals.
  
# The instance after the arrow is the comma-separated list of parent goals, if
# any.

# If a speech act is listed as a parent, preceded by an @ symbol, then this
# goal will be a possible suggestion for the speech act if there is no active
# goal.

# Examples:

# Creating/making is acceptable as top-level goal
# ONT::CREATE =>
# Putting can be part of making
# ONT::PUT => ONT::CREATE
